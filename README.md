### Create your token by going to Setting's > Developer settings > Personal Access Token > Generate New Token
#### Set never expire, click repo all permissions then copy paste to main.py

#### app.py is not available in this repo and is owned by [D4RKH0R1Z0N](https://github.com/D4RKH0R1Z0N) and its not important at all in ID-API (IP-API)
#### ID-API was a typo I meant to type IP-API and Decided to go with it and continue ðŸ˜“
